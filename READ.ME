Time-Series-Forecasting-on-U.S.-Economic-Indicators-
This research focuses on time series forecasting for four key financial assets: SP-500, EUR-USD, Gold, and Crude Oil. Time series forecasting creates models from past data and applies them to predict what will be observed in the future. The intention is to provide future-oriented insights to support strategic decision-making. Three essential elements involved in time series analysis are seasonality (regular patterns), cyclical fluctuations, and trend (consistent movement). Nonetheless, while making judgments based on projections, it’s critical to take uncertainty and other influences into account. We used three Uni-variate forecasting models: Simple Exponential Smoothing, Moving Average, ARIMA; and 2 Multivariate mod- els: SARIMAX, and XGBoost. While we used several accuracy metrics, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the main performance metric. The results indicate that Simple Exponential Smoothing outperformed the other models with an RMSE of 0.16, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns in the data. Following it is the Moving average, with an RMSE of 0.84. On the other hand, ARIMA, SARIMAX, and XGBOOST scored a higher RMSE of 1.66, 1.89, and 1.53 respectively. These results suggest lower forecasting accuracy and performance for more complex models with more features and capabilities.
